\begin{abstract}

With the popularization of Google's deep-learning, artificial intelligence and machine learning have 
become the most sought after topics in computer science. However, the large body of existing literature
on the topic can be overwhelming. This paper provides an overview of artificial intelligence and machine 
learning, presenting the principal characteristics of existing techniques. Given the variety of techniques 
and applications, we focus this work as an introduction to artificial intelligence and 
machine learning for practitioners, considering the most common problems and uses encounter for 
these techniques. We use an empirical experimentation of two different projects where we identified 
problem/project characteristics suitable for supervised learning models (linear regression) and 
unsupervised models (neural networks). This work serves as an introductory overview to understand 
the basic applications of machine learning.

(re your paper - abstract and conclusion dont really match, bring from conclusion into abstract the bit that this is aimed at software development practictioners/industry , id remove "theres little udnerstanding of the itnernals" but make it how theres vast body of literatyre and can be overwhelming so here you present overview for the most common problems non-ai professionals might encounter in industry, smth like that)
cuz without ath its not clear what the scope is, its not really a research paper, then at one point it seems to have a scope of a AI/ML textbook for a course, while i think it is really summary adn how to guide on ai for software developers/dummies?
