With the popularization of Google's deep-learning, artificial intelligence and machine learning have 
become the most sought after topics in computer science. However, there is little understanding about 
the internals of this domain, leading to the incorrect application of artificial intelligence techniques in 
distinct software projects. This paper provides an overview of artificial intelligence and machine 
learning, presenting the principal characteristics of existing techniques. Given the variety of techniques 
and applications we consider one question: what is the best machine learning technique to use for 
different types of applications. Our work responds to this question based on empirical experimentation 
where we identified the characteristics of different problems to be suitable for  supervised learning 
models (linear regression) and unsupervised models (neural networks). This work serves as an 
introductory overview to understand the basic applications of machine learning.

With the popularization of deep-learning by google, artificial intelligence and machine learning have become one of the most sought after topics in computer science. However, there is little understanding about the internals of this domain, leading to the incorrect application of artificial intelligence techniques in distinct software projects. This paper provides an overview of artificial intelligence and machine learning, presenting the principal characteristics of existing techniques. Additionally, the paper provides a perspective about the applicability and usability of such techniques in diverse software projects.
