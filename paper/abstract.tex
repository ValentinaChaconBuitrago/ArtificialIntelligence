\begin{abstract}
With the popularization of deep-learning by google, artificial intelligence and machine learning have become the most sought after topics in computer science. However, there is little understanding about the internals of this domain, leading to the incorrect application of artificial intelligence techniques in distinct software projects. This paper provides an overview of artificial intelligence and machine learning, presenting the principal characteristics of existing techniques. Additionally, the paper provides a perspective about the applicability and usability of such techniques in diverse software projects.
